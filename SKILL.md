# Eleven-Star Experience Design

Design exceptional customer experiences by imagining progressively extraordinary versions - from 5-star baseline through 11-star fantasy - then work backward to find the feasible sweet spot that delights beyond expectations.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design experiences that deceive, manipulate, or exploit customers
- Create experiences that promise more than can be delivered
- Ignore ethical implications of "extraordinary" features
- Design experiences that violate customer privacy or consent

**If asked to design harmful experiences:** Refuse explicitly. Explain that exceptional experiences build trust, never break it.

---

## When to Use

- Designing any customer touchpoint (onboarding, checkout, support)
- Planning product features or service improvements
- Breaking out of "adequate" thinking to find memorable solutions
- When teams are stuck optimizing for 5-star instead of aiming higher
- Creating experiences customers will talk about
- Differentiating from competitors who stop at "good enough"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| experience_to_design | Yes | The customer touchpoint, moment, or journey to elevate |
| customer_context | No | Who is the customer? What state are they in? |
| current_baseline | No | What does the current (or typical) experience look like? |
| constraints | No | Budget, time, technical, or regulatory limitations |
| goal | No | What would success look like? What should customers feel/do? |

## The 11-Star Framework

Brian Chesky developed this framework at Airbnb to push teams beyond incremental improvement. The methodology:

1. Define what a standard 5-star experience looks like
2. Progressively imagine 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11-star versions
3. Recognize that 10-11 stars are impossible/impractical
4. Work backward to find the "sweet spot" - extraordinary but feasible
5. Implement the sweet spot

**The key insight:** "If I say 'what can I do to make this better?' they'll say something small. If I say 'what would it take for you to tell every single person you've ever encountered?' - that's a different question."

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Experience and Customer

Establish the baseline:

**The Moment:** What specific touchpoint or journey are we designing?
**The Customer:** Give them a name. Who are they? What state are they in when they arrive?
**Current Reality:** What does a typical (or your current) experience look like?
**Success Criteria:** What would make this customer tell everyone about this?

### Step 2: Map the Star Levels

For each level, describe what the experience would look like:

| Level | Description | Feasibility |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **1-star** | Terrible - what would make this actively bad? | (Baseline negative) |
| **3-star** | Okay - functional but forgettable | (Common) |
| **5-star** | Good - standard quality, meets expectations | (Current target) |
| **6-star** | Very good - small surprise that delights | (Achievable) |
| **7-star** | Great - thoughtful touch that impresses | (Stretch) |
| **8-star** | Excellent - personalized, memorable | (Ambitious) |
| **9-star** | Extraordinary - unexpectedly generous | (Difficult) |
| **10-star** | Fantasy - impractical but illuminating | (Not feasible) |
| **11-star** | Impossible - pure imagination | (Not feasible) |

### Step 3: The Beatles Check-In Test

Chesky's example for Airbnb check-in:

- 5-star: Host lets you in
- 6-star: Host welcomes you, has snacks, shows you around
- 7-star: Host picks you up at the airport
- 8-star: Host picks you up in a limousine
- 9-star: Private jet picks you up
- 10-star: The Beatles check-in - 5,000 screaming fans at the airport, press conference
- 11-star: You go to space

Use this as calibration - by the time you reach 10-star, it should feel absurd but illuminating.

### Step 4: Find the Sweet Spot

The goal is not 11 stars. The goal is finding the sweet spot.

Ask:
- Which levels are actually feasible with current resources?
- Which ideas from higher levels could be adapted to lower cost/effort?
- What's the highest level we could sustainably deliver?
- Where's the point of diminishing returns?

**The sweet spot is usually between 6 and 8 stars** - extraordinary enough to be memorable, feasible enough to implement.

### Step 5: Design the Implementation

For your chosen sweet spot:

1. **Define the specific experience** - What exactly happens?
2. **Identify the wow moment** - What's the single most memorable element?
3. **Map the details** - What must be true for this to work?
4. **Anticipate failure modes** - What could break the magic?
5. **Measure success** - How will you know it's working?

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details

- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## 11-Star Experience Design: Project Management SaaS Onboarding

### The Customer Moment

**Experience:** First 10 minutes after signup - the moment between "I signed up" and "I'm actually using this"
**Customer:** Sarah - project manager at a 50-person marketing agency, overwhelmed with multiple tools, just convinced her team to try ONE MORE project management app
**Current Reality:** Email confirmation, tour modal she clicks through, empty dashboard, "Create your first project" prompt, alone and unsure where to start
**Success Metric:** Sarah messages her team saying "This one is actually different - you need to try this"

### Star Level Progression

| Level | Experience Description | Key Feature |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| 1-star | Broken signup flow, no confirmation, logs her out | Technical failure |
| 3-star | Account works, generic tutorial video, figure it out yourself | Minimal support |
| 5-star | Guided tour, template library, clear first steps | Standard SaaS onboarding |
| 6-star | Personalized welcome based on role (PM-specific tips), relevant templates surfaced first | Role recognition |
| 7-star | Sample project pre-populated showing how Sarah's work would look, with her company name | Personalized preview |
| 8-star | Live human onboarding specialist for first 15 minutes, walks her through HER first real project | Personal guide |
| 9-star | AI analyzes her calendar/email (with permission) and pre-creates project structure based on actual work | Intelligent setup |
| 10-star | Onboarding team visits her office, sets up entire team, migrates all existing projects, trains everyone | White-glove service |
| 11-star | Time machine - her projects are already done, she's relaxing on a beach while the tool runs her agency | Fantasy |

### Sweet Spot Analysis

**Recommended Level:** 7-star
**Rationale:** The personalized sample project (7-star) provides the "this is actually different" moment without requiring human resources (8-star) or complex integrations (9-star). It can be automated at scale while feeling individual.

**Ideas to Borrow from Higher Levels:**
- From 8-star: Option to request live onboarding (for enterprise tier, or first 10 signups/day)
- From 9-star: Simple integration with Google Calendar to auto-suggest project names from upcoming meetings

### Implementation Design

**The Experience:**
When Sarah signs up, she provides her role (Project Manager) and company name (Marketing Agency). Instead of an empty dashboard, she sees "Sarah's First Campaign Project" - a fully populated sample project for a "Q2 Marketing Campaign" with:
- Realistic task names a PM would recognize
- Due dates relative to today
- Sample team members with placeholder avatars
- A completed task and an overdue task to show notifications
- A comment thread showing how collaboration works

The sample project is clearly labeled "Sample - delete anytime" but demonstrates exactly how HER work could look.

**The Wow Moment:** Seeing her company name and role-relevant content on first login - "Wait, this was made for me?"

**Required Elements:**
1. Role and company name capture during signup (2 extra fields)
2. 5-7 industry-specific sample project templates (Marketing, Product, Engineering, etc.)
3. Dynamic content insertion (company name, dates, role-specific terminology)
4. Clear "this is a sample" labeling to avoid confusion

**Failure Modes to Prevent:**
- Sample feels generic despite personalization - Mitigation: Ensure industry-specific terminology, not generic "Project A"
- User doesn't understand it's a sample - Mitigation: Prominent "Sample Project" badge, easy delete
- User wants to keep sample structure - Mitigation: "Convert to real project" option

**Success Indicators:**
- Time to first real project created (target: < 10 minutes)
- Activation rate increase vs control (target: 20% lift)
- First-week retention (target: 15% improvement)
- Qualitative: watch session recordings for "wow" moments

### First Steps

1. Create 3 industry-specific sample project templates (Marketing, Product, Engineering)
2. Build dynamic content insertion for company name and dates
3. A/B test against current empty-dashboard onboarding
4. Monitor session recordings for reaction to sample project

## Constraints

- Each star level must be distinct - if you cannot differentiate 7 from 8, collapse them
- The 10-11 star versions should feel impractical - if they seem feasible, you are not thinking big enough
- Focus on one touchpoint at a time - do not try to redesign entire journeys in one exercise
- The sweet spot is subjective - different constraints yield different sweet spots
- This is a brainstorming framework, not a specification - implementation planning comes after

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Cannot differentiate star levels | Experience may be too narrow; expand scope or accept fewer levels |
| 10-star seems achievable | Thinking too small; add more imagination, remove constraints mentally |
| Sweet spot seems too conservative | Check constraints; can any be relaxed? |
| Sweet spot seems too ambitious | Check resources; what would make higher levels feasible? |
| Team disagrees on sweet spot | Document options at different levels; test with customers |
| Experience is primarily functional (not emotional) | Focus on how it FEELS, not just what it does |

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Brian Chesky** expert persona. It embodies the Airbnb methodology for designing experiences that create evangelists rather than satisfied customers.

Pairs well with:
- **storyboard-experience** (Walt Disney) - for mapping the journey frame-by-frame
- **product-vision-frame** (Steve Jobs) - for connecting experience to product vision
- **do-things-that-dont-scale** - for implementing sweet spot with handcrafted care
